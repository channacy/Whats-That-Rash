**What's That Rash?** is a web app that helps users identify skin conditions with just a photo. Users upload an image of their skin issue (such as a rash, bump, or bruise) and add descriptive tags. Our AI dermatologist analyzes the input and provides a likely diagnosis. Users can then generate a professional PDF report and email it directly to a doctor.

Additionally, the app offers personalized skincare routines based on the user‚Äôs skin type and concerns, with a link to product recommendations, blending medical insight with daily care.

# Features

With our web app, simply upload an image of your condition (Rash, bumps, bruises), include tags describing what the skin condition is like, and our AI dermatologist will determine what the skin condition most likely is. Afterwards, an option to generate a PDF of the report and email it to your doctor will be available.

Furthermore, we added the option to provide üß¥ skincare routine treatments based on skin type and noted concerns.

# Tools, Frameworks and API
We used the Streamlit framework for rapid prototyping and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 Vision API for image interpretation. To improve medical accuracy, we reinforced the system using a curated Skin Disease Classification dataset and fine-tuned it for dermatological relevance.
