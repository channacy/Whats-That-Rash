# What's The Rash?

We have developed an AI web app, "What's The Rash?" to help patients with skin conditions find put more about their skin condition with just a picture.

# Features

With our web app, simply upload an image of your condition (Rash, bumps, bruises), include tags describing what the skin condition is like, and our AI dermatologist will determine what the skin condition most likely is.

Afterwards, an option to generate a PDF of the report and email it to your doctor will be available.

# Frameworks and API
Utilised the Streamlit framework and OpenAI's Vision API
